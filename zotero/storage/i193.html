During the years of high school physics, instructors would tell us how 
asymmetry in Maxwell's equations express the fact that while there are 
stable particles carrying electric charge in nature, there are no 
magnets with a single pole. Yet Dirac had suggested the idea of a 
magnetic monopole decades before I was born, and around the time I was 
attending high school, Cabrera was starting his experiments to find one.
 I first learned about the possibility of the existence of such a 
particle when in graduate school. The idea of proving wrong something I 
had learned to take for granted, was exciting. Of course, whether a 
stable particle which carries magnetic charge does exist or not has 
profound implications for our understanding of the universe, but still, 
what makes the very idea of a magnetic monopole so attractive to me is 
that there are not that many basic, everyday things left -- things like 
the indivisibility of a magnet -- to be confirmed yet.

This work describes a search for the magnetic monopole, as it is 
postulated in many Grand Unified Theories (GUT). Such monopoles are 
expected to be heavy ([…] GeV), may have a large range of velocities and
 -- from current astrophysical constraints -- must be very rare. The 
most widely accepted upper limit to their flux comes from considerations
 of the survival of the galactic magnetic field (the Parker Bound 1), 
and it is of the order of […]. This flux regime was explored by MACRO 
(Monopole Astrophysics and Cosmic Ray Observatory), a large area 
detector built in Gran Sasso in Italy.

Specifically, this was a search for slow-moving magnetic monopoles with 
the MACRO detector. MACRO featured a large acceptance ([…] 10,000 […]), 
and three separate detector systems for monopoles. This search relies 
primarily on one of these systems: the scintillation detector. A 
custom-made trigger was developed to detect the passage of slow-moving 
magnetic monopoles […] through a scintillator tank. This trigger was 
employed for the initial selection of events over the data-taking period
 between June 1995 and May 2000. There were around 28 million relevant 
triggers during this period. These represent potential monopole events; 
each must be examined carefully to see if all recorded details are 
consistent with the signature of monopole passage. Analysis of the 
events and final selection was performed mainly with the help of a 
system which digitally sampled and recorded the waveforms of 
photomultipliers monitoring the scintillation detectors. A 
specially-designed pattern recognition algorithm, following the 
philosophy of the slow monopole trigger, was developed, in order to 
identify the signature of slow monopoles in the waveform system, while 
suppressing background generated due to cosmic-ray muons or electronic 
noise.

No events were observed that are consistent with the passage of a slow 
monopole. Detailed data quality checks were performed for each data run 
and the resulting actual configuration of the detector was used in a 
Monte Carlo calculation of the detector's acceptance on a run-by-run
